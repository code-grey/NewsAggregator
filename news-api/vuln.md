# Vulnerability Analysis Report (vuln.md)

This document outlines the security vulnerabilities identified in the Go news API based on the OWASP Top 10 and other common security risks.

| OWASP 2021 Rank | Category | Status & Analysis |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **A01** | **Broken Access Control** | **Not Applicable (Public API)**. The API is designed to be public and read-only. There are no user accounts or protected resources, so access control is not required for the current scope. |
| **A02** | **Cryptographic Failures** | **High Risk (Mitigated by Recommendation)**. The service uses standard HTTP without TLS encryption. This exposes traffic to sniffing and Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) attacks. **Patch:** This cannot be fixed in code without a certificate. **Recommendation:** The service must be deployed behind a reverse proxy (e.g., Nginx, Caddy) that handles TLS termination. |
| **A03** | **Injection** | **Low Risk (Mitigated)**. The API does not take any user input that is passed to a database or shell. The primary vector, HTML/JS injection from upstream RSS feeds, is mitigated by using `bluemonday` to sanitize all description fields before they are sent to the client. |
| **A04** | **Insecure Design** | **Medium Risk (Patched)**. The original design lacked any mechanism to prevent abuse. An attacker could flood the `/news` endpoint, causing a Denial of Service (DoS) for other users and potentially getting our server's IP address blocked by the RSS feed providers. **Patch:** Implemented a rate limiter to prevent request flooding. |
| **A05** | **Security Misconfiguration** | **Medium Risk (Patched)**. The server was not configured with basic security best practices. It was missing common security headers that help protect clients from attacks like clickjacking and content sniffing. **Patch:** Implemented a middleware to add security headers (`Content-Security-Policy`, `X-Content-Type-Options`, etc.) to all responses. |
| **A06** | **Vulnerable Components** | **Low Risk (Mitigated by Recommendation)**. The application relies on third-party libraries (`gofeed`, `bluemonday`). While these are well-maintained, a zero-day vulnerability could be discovered. **Recommendation:** Regularly scan dependencies for known CVEs and keep them updated using `go mod tidy` and `go list -m -u all`. |
| **A09** | **Logging & Monitoring Failures** | **Medium Risk (Patched)**. The original logging was minimal, only recording server start and parsing errors. It provided no visibility into incoming requests, which is insufficient for detecting or investigating an attack. **Patch:** Implemented a request logging middleware that records the method, URL, remote address, and status of every request. |
| **A10** | **Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF)** | **Not Applicable (by design)**. The application only makes requests to a hardcoded, developer-controlled list of RSS feeds. Users cannot provide their own URLs, which is the primary vector for SSRF attacks. This would become a critical risk if user-supplied URLs were ever introduced. |

### Other Common Vulnerabilities

| Vulnerability | Status & Analysis |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Denial of Service (DoS)** | **Medium Risk (Patched)**. Addressed via rate limiting. The use of a timeout on the HTTP client also prevents the server from hanging on unresponsive RSS feeds. |
| **XML External Entity (XXE)** | **Low Risk (Mitigated by Library)**. The Go standard library's `encoding/xml` package, used by `gofeed`, is not vulnerable to XXE attacks by default as it does not process external entities. This is a key defense against malicious XML feeds. |
