# Security Report: Ad-Aware News Aggregator Backend

## Overview

This report details the security analysis and enhancements applied to the Go-based backend API for the "Ad-Aware News Aggregator" application. The analysis was conducted with a focus on the OWASP Top 10 vulnerabilities and other common attack vectors that could be exploited by malicious actors.

## Key Findings and Mitigations

The initial review identified several areas for improvement, primarily related to lack of basic security hygiene for a public-facing API. The following vulnerabilities were identified and addressed:

*   **A02: Cryptographic Failures (Lack of TLS):**
    *   **Finding:** The API operates over plain HTTP, making traffic vulnerable to eavesdropping and Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) attacks.
    *   **Mitigation:** This is a deployment-level concern. The report recommends deploying the API behind a reverse proxy (e.g., Nginx, Caddy) configured for TLS termination. This ensures all external communication is encrypted.

*   **A04: Insecure Design (Denial of Service):**
    *   **Finding:** The API was susceptible to request flooding, which could lead to service disruption and potential IP blacklisting by RSS feed providers.
    *   **Mitigation:** A **rate-limiting middleware** was implemented. This limits the number of requests a client can make within a given timeframe, effectively mitigating DoS attacks.

*   **A05: Security Misconfiguration (Missing Security Headers):**
    *   **Finding:** The API lacked essential HTTP security headers, leaving clients vulnerable to common browser-based attacks.
    *   **Mitigation:** A **security headers middleware** was added. This middleware sets:
        *   `Content-Security-Policy`: Mitigates XSS and data injection attacks.
        *   `X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff`: Prevents MIME-sniffing attacks.
        *   `X-Frame-Options: DENY`: Prevents clickjacking attacks.
        *   `Strict-Transport-Security`: Enforces HTTPS for future connections (when deployed with TLS).

*   **A09: Logging & Monitoring Failures (Insufficient Logging):**
    *   **Finding:** The API's logging was minimal, hindering incident detection and investigation.
    *   **Mitigation:** A **request logging middleware** was implemented. This logs details of every incoming request (method, URL, remote address, and response time), providing better visibility for monitoring and debugging.

*   **Injection (HTML/JS from RSS Feeds):**
    *   **Finding:** RSS feed descriptions can contain arbitrary HTML/JavaScript, posing a potential Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) risk if rendered directly by clients.
    *   **Mitigation:** The `bluemonday` library was integrated to **sanitize all HTML content** from RSS feed descriptions. This ensures that only safe HTML is passed to the client, preventing XSS vulnerabilities in consuming applications (like the Android app or the test frontend).

## Remaining Considerations

*   **Vulnerable Components (A06):** While current dependencies are considered safe, continuous monitoring for new CVEs in third-party libraries is crucial. Regular updates using `go mod tidy` and `go list -m -u all` are recommended.
*   **Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF):** The current design is not vulnerable as RSS feed URLs are hardcoded. However, if the application were ever to allow user-supplied URLs for fetching content, a robust SSRF protection mechanism would be immediately required.

## Conclusion

The applied patches significantly enhance the security posture of the Ad-Aware News Aggregator backend. By addressing common vulnerabilities related to access control, data integrity, and operational visibility, the API is now more resilient against various attack vectors. Continued vigilance, regular security audits, and adherence to secure development practices are recommended to maintain a strong security posture.
