You are a senior Android developer. Your task is to rapidly prototype an Android application named "Ad-Aware News Aggregator." The goal is to create a complete, minimal, and functional project structure that can be easily built upon. The project must strictly adhere to modern Android development best practices.

**Project Name:** AdAwareNewsAggregator
**Package Name:** com.codegrey.adawarenewsaggregator

**Core Requirements:**
1.  **Application Logic:** The app will fetch news articles from a RESTful API and display them in a list. It will also simulate the fetching and displaying of banner ads from a separate, mock API.
2.  **Architecture:** Implement the MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel) pattern with a Repository layer.
3.  **UI Framework:** Use Jetpack Compose for the entire user interface.
4.  **Language:** All code must be in Kotlin.
5.  **Dependency Management:** Use Kotlin DSL (`build.gradle.kts`) for all dependencies.

**Technical Stack & Libraries:**
* **Asynchronous Operations:** Kotlin Coroutines and StateFlow for UI state.
* **Dependency Injection:** Hilt.
* **Networking:** Retrofit for API calls.
* **Image Loading:** Coil for loading images from URLs.
* **Navigation:** A simple navigation structure using `rememberNavController`.

**Specific Tasks for the Prompt:**

**1. Directory Structure:**
Generate the complete directory structure for the project. The structure should separate concerns into `data`, `domain`, and `ui` packages.

**2. `build.gradle.kts` Files:**
* **Project-level:** Configure the plugins for Android Application, Kotlin, and Hilt. Define the versions for all key dependencies.
* **App-level:** Apply the necessary plugins. Add all dependencies for Jetpack Compose, Hilt, Coroutines, Lifecycle, Retrofit, and Coil. Configure `buildFeatures` for `compose = true`.

**3. Initial Code Scaffolding:**
Generate the boilerplate code for the following components, including clear comments and to-do placeholders:

* **Models (`data` package):**
    * `NewsArticle.kt`: A data class representing a news article (e.g., `title`, `description`, `imageUrl`, `url`).
    * `Ad.kt`: A data class representing an ad (e.g., `imageUrl`, `targetUrl`).
    * `NetworkResult.kt`: A sealed class to handle network states (e.g., `Success`, `Error`, `Loading`).

* **API Service (`data` package):**
    * `NewsApiService.kt`: A Retrofit interface with a function to get a list of news articles.
    * `AdApiService.kt`: A Retrofit interface for a mock ad API. This should return a single `Ad` object.

* **Repository (`domain` package):**
    * `NewsRepository.kt`: A class that uses the `NewsApiService` and `AdApiService`. Implement two functions: one to fetch news and another to fetch an ad. Use a Flow to emit `NetworkResult` states.

* **Hilt Modules (`di` package):**
    * `AppModule.kt`: A Hilt module that provides singletons for the `Retrofit` instance, `NewsApiService`, `AdApiService`, and `NewsRepository`.

* **ViewModel (`ui.news` package):**
    * `NewsViewModel.kt`: A class that extends `ViewModel`. It should use the `NewsRepository` to fetch data and expose the news list and ad data as a `StateFlow`. Handle all network states within this ViewModel.

* **UI Composables (`ui.news` package):**
    * `NewsScreen.kt`: A Composable function that takes the `NewsViewModel` state and displays the UI.
    * `NewsList.kt`: A Composable to display the list of `NewsArticle` items.
    * `AdBanner.kt`: A Composable to display the `Ad` banner.
    * Handle the different `NetworkResult` states (`Loading`, `Success`, `Error`) in the UI.

* **Main Application Class:**
    * Create an application class annotated with `@HiltAndroidApp`.

* **`MainActivity.kt`:**
    * Set up the main activity with a basic `Surface` and a `NewsScreen` Composable.

**4. Instructions and Error Avoidance:**
* Add a `README.md` file with clear, step-by-step instructions on how to set up the project (e.g., adding an API key, running the app).
* Add comments in the code to highlight where to implement key logic (e.g., "TODO: Implement proper error handling logic here").
* Ensure all necessary imports are included.
* The generated code should be runnable after adding the necessary API keys and filling in the "TODO" placeholders.

Provide the complete, commented, and well-structured code for each file, not just the names. This entire output should serve as a functional starting point for the project.
